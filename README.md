# New Rust Project Skeleton

Rust requires a few bits of setup. These are files that are fairly
helpful for that.

If you've not done so, you should install rust. the `./tools`
directory has scripts that can help.

* *`rustup_install.sh`* is a copy of the rustup setup script, taken
  from `curl https://sh.rustup.rs`.

* *`rust_setup.sh`* updates rust. It also has comments which can
  include other very helpful modules like clippy and wasm.


TODO: See new project doc.

# ProjectName

One sentence description for outside people.

## What is it?

A brief discussion of the project, with low jargon, that can be read
by someone at the VP level who is short on time and understand what
this project is about. It's also useful for folks outside the group
who might be interested and might want to help you out.

## Requirements

If this project has any external requirements (e.g. a Database,
specific logging, compiler versions, account permissions, etc.) note
those. You may need to point to locations or additional instructions.

## Setting Up

List steps to set up a development environment (if needed). Include
any special one-time instructions if required.


Note: When picking a project name, it's best to find a name that
someone outside your team or knowledge space can easily understand.
This can be useful for high level executives and decision makers who
may need to be following dozens of projects, as well as folks looking
for interesting projects to work on. Boring names are ok, if they
clearly convey meaning.

e.g. "LabtharGyroHammer" is clever, but coveys little meaning.
MysqlAuth_Rust conveys far more information and will be less likely to
be forgotten.

Think of your project name is a variable name.
