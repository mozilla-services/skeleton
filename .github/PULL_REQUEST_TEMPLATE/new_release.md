- [ ]`git commit -m "chore: tag {version}"` to commit the new version and record of changes.
- [ ]`git tag -s -m "chore: tag {version}" {version}` to create a signed tag of the current HEAD commit for release.
- [ ]`git push --set-upstream origin release/{major}.{minor}` to push the commits to a new origin release branch.
- [ ]`git push --tags origin release/{major}.{minor}` to push the tags to the release branch.
